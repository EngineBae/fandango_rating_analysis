# Analyzing Fandango Ratings from 2015 and 2016

We're going to analyze recent movie ratings from Fandango to determine whether there has been any change in their rating system after [Walt Hickey's analysis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/). In summary of Hickey's findings, the analysis found that Fandango generally rounded up their ratings, making their ratings slightly higher than ratings found in other websites. Fandango did react to this and said they fixed the problem. In this project, we'll see if Fandango did indeed adjust their rating algorithms.

Data used by Hickey is available [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango). Data that we will use to analyze the system's characteristics after Hickey's analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17).
